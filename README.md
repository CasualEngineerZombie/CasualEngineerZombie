- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to code. Writing programs is like drawing or painting on a blank canvas â€” the possibilities are endless. I am especially fond of web and mobile development. Outside of programming, I am a very curious person who always wonders why things are the way they are. I read a lot, and love to learn primarily by just going out and doing it. I enjoy spending time with friends, discussing current events, collaborating in coding projects, and learning new technology.
